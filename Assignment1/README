There are Two Screen Shots for submission of part A for Assignment1, in this Folder one is for demo of TCP Socket Programming and another one is for UDP Socket Programming.
For Part B there is folder named SocketProgramming which contains source code for both server and client.
If you are running linux OS then by running the runScript from main folder you should be able to run both client and server if you are not then you will have to manually run both client and server 
as per you like.

Explanation of Code:

Here Server will first start and will wait for client. After Client starts it will try to establish connection with server. If the connection is established successfully then client will first send 
file name.
Note: I am expecting here that file name will not be more then the size of buffer at server which will always be the case.
Client will pass file name as a string and Immidiatly as soon as server receives file name it will create file name with the name received from client.
After that Client will flush the pipe so that there wont be ant overlapping of data.
Evevn though files here are comparativley small for the demo I have kept buffer of size 4bytes to make sure that client will send all data byte by byte and it will also work for larger file size.
